//LEETCODE --> 2360 LONGEST CYCLE IN THE GRAPH

//SOLVED WITH YOUTUBE HELP
/*a directed graph where each node has at most one outgoing edge (represented by an array edges).

edges[i] = j means there is a directed edge from node i â†’ j.

edges[i] = -1 means node i has no outgoing edge.

Your task is to find the length of the longest cycle in the graph.
If there is no cycle, return -1. */

/*SOLUTION : The core logic is to find cycles in the directed graph and get its length checked .To compare the lenghts of the
cycles i hvae used the path vector and the length variabele to mark the distance of the neighbour nodes form the source and 
finally use it for the length calculation*/
